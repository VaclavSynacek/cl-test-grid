The server part of CL Test Grid, running on Google App Engine,
and a lisp client for its HTTP interface.

It provides:
- Online storage of the library test logs;
- Submit point of the test run results lisp data,
  and forwarding them to the admin by email
  (deprecated feature, since we started do submit results
  to test-grid-storage).

The serer side is implemented on Java (few small
servlets; maybe sometime we will be able
to use ABCL instead, or just move the functionality
to Heroku + Amazon S3 and use any Lisp).
