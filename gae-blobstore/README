The server part of CL Test Grid, running on Google App Engine,
and a lisp client for its HTTP interface.

It provides:
- Online storage of the library test logs;
- Submit point of the test run results lisp data
  (and forwarding them to the admin by email).

The serer side is implemented on Java (just
few lines; maybe sometime we will be able
to use ABCL instead).
