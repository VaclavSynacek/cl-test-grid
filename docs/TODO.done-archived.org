** DONE information about test run:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:41]
   lisp-version-string, 
   lib-world, 
   author contact (get it from some settings file),

** DONE format the DB equally on all the Lisps                           :db:
   CLOSED: [2012-03-01 Чт 05:02]

   4h
** DONE better decision for library name representation.
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:42]
     This representation is used in the:
     - libtest method parameter (eql specialized)
     - in the database and testrun datastructure.
     Possible alternatives:
     a keyword
        good for READ (package independent),
        good for EQL specializer
        good for GETF when working with the database
     a symbol from the test-grid package
        - good for EQL specializer
        - package dependent in READ
        - good for GETF when working with the database
        - adds one more (unnecessary) way to represent a library 
          in addition the specified for ASDF and Quicklisp
     or a downcased string
        - needs special handling in libtest eql specialization
        - good ro READ (package independent)
        - needs care to work with GETF when working with the database      
** DONE A tool to generate fake DB content to test reporting
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:42]
** DONE simpliest reporting to overview the libraries test statuses [6/6] :report:

*** DONE Test Runs report: every test run as a row in a table :report:testruns:
    CLOSED: [2012-01-13 Пт 14:26]
     + legend or a tooltip in the report for test statuses
     + color for statuses
     + use the online blob URL in the report
*** DONE A pivot -like table report of library test results, allowing :report:pivot:
    CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:43]
    rows/columns to be any of quicklisp distro, lisp version
    library name. With grouping and sorging.
*** DONE Fix rows and columns highlight in the pivot reports   :report:pivot:
    CLOSED: [2012-01-13 Пт 14:24]
*** DONE CSV export of the database to use it then with spreadsheets, :report:csv:
    CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:57]
     google fusion tables, etc. Initial intent
     was to format it as a pivot for various projections 
     (by quicklisp releases, by platform, etc).
     But neither google docs spreadsheet, nor google fusion
     table allow as to format results as we want
     (the main problem, it is impossible to use
     a custom aggregation function for pivot
     cells, because standard aggregation functions
     are numeric, but we want a report cell
     to represent test result(s) for a particular
     library, i.e. :ok, :fail, :no-resource).
     5h
*** DONE Test that the test-duration field value                 :report:csv:
    CLOSED: [2011-12-28 Ср 20:20]
     (Common Lisp rational) can be read
     by spreadsheet software (MS/Open Offices,

** DONE change db format                                                 :db:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   + test run as plist (:descr <descr> :run-results <run-results>)
     instead of just (<descr> <run-results>)
   + run-results as a list instead of plist; libname
     which was a plist key is now a property of the lib-result 
     object. It is more convenient for standard mapping functions, 
     instead of current do-lib-results.
** DONE add more libraries: total number of 20 libraries              :agent:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   is enough for the beginning.
   Result: we have 23 libraries.
** DONE when loading of a library or library test system              :agent:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   fails, ensure we have the error description in the output
   0.5h
** DONE The "thank you" message: where exactly to submit test results?
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   Specify an email or issue tracker of the cl-test-grid project.
** DONE how to store public (central) database and failed library 
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   outputs (files).
   An appealing way is to store it in the same git repository 
   on github, but with the std-out files the repository will 
   quickly grow to an unconvenient size (for new people the
   checkout procedure will be too long to be considered
   convenient)
   5h
   Solution: files are stored in Google App Engine blob store.
** DONE More detailed output for libraries using the RT test
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   framework. Ensure the libs with other test framework
   are all have sufficiently detailed output too.
** DONE Log of the BABEL tests (generated by the Stefil test          :agent:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   framework) does not contain information about
   errors. Add these details.
** DONE Some libraries (babel and cl-json) stil print messages to 
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:56]
   console, meaning their output is not only *standard-output*
   and *standard-error*. Fix that, all the output
   should be in the log files, but not on console.
** DONE run the tests on all the implementations available for us.
   CLOSED: [2012-01-12 Чт 09:45]
** DONE publish the reports
   CLOSED: [2011-12-28 Ср 06:57]

** DONE finalize the decision what command user runs
   CLOSED: [2011-12-20 Вт 04:19]
   to performs the tests. Describe this main command
   in the README (in the first paragraph).
   The solution: user runs (load "agent.lisp"); precondition: quicklisp installed.
** DONE When the settings file is populated, inform user where     :settings:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-31 Сб 01:59]
   it is stored (and to be sure user understood us, ask
   him to press Enter before continuing).
** DONE When asking user for email, explain him more carefully     :settings:
   CLOSED: [2012-01-12 Чт 09:45]
   how the email will be used and ensure there is a way
   to avoid providing email.
** DONE ECL: recover from stack alexandria overflow and continute tests :ecl:agent:

** DONE Optimize horizontal space in the reports: the headers        :report:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-31 Сб 04:58]
   take to much space
** DONE more abstract accessor to parts of DB info instead of
   CLOSED: [2011-12-20 Вт 04:29]
   getf by properties: run-descr, run-results.

   0.5h
** DONE accumulate failed library output
   CLOSED: [2011-12-20 Вт 04:29]
   1h
** DONE run-libtests: redirect the library output to log file directly
   CLOSED: [2012-01-10 Вт 05:01]
   without caching it in memory. It is more convenient when you are 
   watching the testing process, you can observe the file being 
   populated with logs (because some libraries, like flexi-streams, 
   take time about minute to finish, and if during this minute
   nithing happens it is not user-friendly)

* Milestone 0.1

   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Пн 20:17]
   write the unhandled error stacktrace (with causes)

* 0.4.1 Code cleanup after finishing lisp-agent
** DONE review test suites which have hard-coded failures
   CLOSED: [2012-08-03 Пт 04:20]
   due to hang-ups or other problems and consider
   removing the hardcoded failures as we now have
   timeouts for hang-ups.
** DONE push forward breaking-up the old monolitic module test-grid:
   CLOSED: [2012-08-03 Пт 03:22]
   test grid systems will consist of modules for:
   - testsuites 
     a function libtest(libname) runs test suite
     of the specified library, downloading the lib from quicklisp
     if necessary, and returns test result in a unified format.
     I.e. the module knows how to invoke the library test suite
     and has adapters for test results of various test frameworks
     to the testgrid test result format.
   - agent
     the program with can run test in child lisp processes,
     knows which lisps the contributor has on the machine,
     decides when to run tests, and can upload the test
     results to the central server.
     [the changes required are small - agent will receive
     some code from the current test-grid.lisp,
     for example test suite log header/footer printing.
     Maybe the test suite log will include whole lisp
     process output, from the lisp startup (now we 
     start logging bit later, right before invoking
     the test suite)]
   - admin
     code to receive test results and add to db
     [remains unchanged]
   - reporting
     [reamains unchanged]
   - blobstore
     [remains unchanges]
   - data 
     objects moving between other modules: test run, test results,
     printing for these objects; and the database
   - utils

** DONE agent fs structure functions: make the workdir root
   CLOSED: [2012-08-03 Пт 03:21]
   a configurable property of agent, and fs structure
   functions shoud accept agent as a parameter.

   Fixes user request by Greg Pfeil: don't install quicklisp in ASDF source registry,
   https://github.com/cl-test-grid/cl-test-grid/issues/5

   In future it will allow for increased speed on multiprocessor
   systems by starting several agent processes, each assigned
   different set of lisp implementations. It would require
   another agent config property - lock-port, for the socket
   whcih assures agent is a signelton. Every 
   agent have different work-dir and different port.

   Several agents may even run in different threads
   of a single lisp process (if global shared libraries
   like asdf whould allow this).
* 0.5.0 Separate status value for compilation failure
  Important in general and a user reques by Juan Jose Garcia-Ripoll.
** DONE Test status should include separate indicator for the library compilation and loading.
   CLOSED: [2012-08-17 Пт 21:48]
   This allows to add even libraries without test cases to the
   test grid.

* 0.5.1 Test loading (including fresh recompilation) of every ASDF system Quicklisp.
  This means even if the library doesn't have a test suite,
  or the test suite is not yet integrated into the test-grid,
  we will know it's compilation status.

  Complications: one project may have more than one ASDF system,
  and in such case it's not clear how to relate compilation
  failures with test suite status, if only part of ASDF systems
  failed to compile.
** DONE Change agent to perform load test of every ASDF system in Quicklisp

   CLOSED: [2012-09-17 Пн 03:39]
   Some are missed because of agent bug: list of project was retrieved

* 0.6.0 Reports Improve 2
** DONE combine information about load failures with information about system dependencies
   CLOSED: [2012-10-01 Пн 07:12]
   It will allow us to find "root" compilation blockers -
   the libraries which do not compile and block other libraries
   compilation.

   After the milestone 0.5.1 we will have compilation status
   for all the ASDF systems in quicklisp on all the lisp implemetations.

   If we combine the compilation statuses with the dependency
   information, it will become visible, what libraries should
   be fixed first to make certain lisp implementation wider adopted.

   Of course, quicklisp download statistics we have already
   provides some information about "importance" of libraries,
   but the dependency information will make the situation more clear.

   This feature is suggested by Juan Jose - the ECL maintainer.


   We now have information which ASDF systems fail to load on particular Lisps
   (this is implemented for the 56 libraries already included into the test-grid,
   and After the milestone 0.5.1 we will have compilation status
   for all the ASDF systems in quicklisp on all the lisp implemetations).

   But ASDF systems depend on each other, so if system A fails to load,
   all other systems which depend on A directly or indirectly fail to load as well.
   So if we just list all the load failures, we are going to have large list, but will
   be unable to see where the real problem is, what is necessary to fix.

   The idea is to combine the information about load failures with information
   about dependencies to find out the root "blockers" - the libraries failing by
   themselves and blocking others.

   To do so we may just sort the ASDF systems by dependencies
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting), and the root blockers
   will be at the top of the list.

   I envision simple report in the form

   system-a: blocked-by: <list of failed systems on which system-a depends>; blocks <list of failed systems depending on system-a>
   system-b: blocked-by: <list of failed systems on which system-b depends>; blocks <list of failed systems depending on system-b>
   ...

   While the real data is not available, you can just hardcode
   two stub functions:
   (load-failed-p <system name>) => true or false,
   and
   (dependencies <system name>) => list of systems on which the given system depends.

   With hardcoded stub information we may already experiment and develop with the report.

   Also, we can extract the dependency information for the real implementation
   of the DEPENDENCIES function. It may be done either by loading
   every system and querying ASDF, or from quicklisp - see file quicklisp\dists\quicklisp\systems.txt
   in your quicklisp installation. Note, there is no way to detect 100% exact
   dependency information, because .asd files are just lisp code,
   and some of them just do (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'something)
   instead of putting something to :depend-on clause of defsystem macro.

** DONE the diff report (aka regressions report) - diff along various dimentions
   CLOSED: [2012-10-01 Пн 08:26]
   Currently we can only find differences between test statuses
   of a library on different quicklisps, when the lisp implementation
   version is a constant.
   We should generalize this to compare test results on two
   different versions of a compiler (windows/linux or old compiler
   version and new one). Also when comparing test results,
   we must be more flexible than matching results only of
   exactly the same lisp-implementation-identifier,
   because we don't always has exactly this lisp.
   For example when we compare the lates qicklisp version
   with the previous one, we may want to consider ecl-12.7.1-dee2506a-linux-x86-lisp-to-c
   and ecl-12.7.1-xxxxffff-linux-x86-lisp-to-c as the same compiler,
   because otherwise we might just have no results to compare.

   In other case, we want to compare test results of these two
   compilers. Then we consider them different and
   different sides of comparision: one on the left hand,
   and another on the right side.

   At first sight the task may be solved
   by parametrizing the report by two functions:
   - the one which decides what results to put to left side and to right side
   - a predicate which decides if a result cell from the left side is comparable
     to a result from the right side.

  ==============
  The solution:
  - select two sets of results
  - compute exclusive-or of them
  - print pivot with necessary columns and rows

  Example is the compiler-diff report and quicklisp-diff

   The libraries being tested are recompiled at every test run.
   It would be good to ensure test-grid-testsuites code is also correctly
   recompiled.

   and hangs.
