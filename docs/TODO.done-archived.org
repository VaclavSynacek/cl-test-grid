* Milestone 0
** DONE information about test run:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:41]
   lisp-version-string, 
   lib-world, 
   author contact (get it from some settings file), 
   date, 
   run-duration
** DONE organize the database file format                                :db:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:42]
** DONE format the DB equally on all the Lisps                           :db:
   CLOSED: [2012-03-01 Чт 05:02]
   so that diff shows only new records.
   (use pprint ?)
   4h
** DONE better decision for library name representation.
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:42]
     This representation is used in the:
     - libtest method parameter (eql specialized)
     - in the database and testrun datastructure.
     Possible alternatives:
     a keyword
        good for READ (package independent),
        good for EQL specializer
        good for GETF when working with the database
     a symbol from the test-grid package
        - good for EQL specializer
        - package dependent in READ
        - good for GETF when working with the database
        - adds one more (unnecessary) way to represent a library 
          in addition the specified for ASDF and Quicklisp
     or a downcased string
        - needs special handling in libtest eql specialization
        - good ro READ (package independent)
        - needs care to work with GETF when working with the database      
** DONE A tool to generate fake DB content to test reporting
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:42]
** DONE simpliest reporting to overview the libraries test statuses [6/6] :report:
   CLOSED: [2012-01-13 Пт 14:26]
*** DONE Test Runs report: every test run as a row in a table :report:testruns:
    CLOSED: [2012-01-13 Пт 14:26]
     + legend or a tooltip in the report for test statuses
     + color for statuses
     + use the online blob URL in the report
*** DONE A pivot -like table report of library test results, allowing :report:pivot:
    CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:43]
    rows/columns to be any of quicklisp distro, lisp version
    library name. With grouping and sorging.
*** DONE Fix rows and columns highlight in the pivot reports   :report:pivot:
    CLOSED: [2012-01-13 Пт 14:24]
*** DONE CSV export of the database to use it then with spreadsheets, :report:csv:
    CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:57]
     google fusion tables, etc. Initial intent
     was to format it as a pivot for various projections 
     (by quicklisp releases, by platform, etc).
     But neither google docs spreadsheet, nor google fusion
     table allow as to format results as we want
     (the main problem, it is impossible to use
     a custom aggregation function for pivot
     cells, because standard aggregation functions
     are numeric, but we want a report cell
     to represent test result(s) for a particular
     library, i.e. :ok, :fail, :no-resource).
     5h
*** DONE Test that the test-duration field value                 :report:csv:
    CLOSED: [2011-12-28 Ср 20:20]
     (Common Lisp rational) can be read
     by spreadsheet software (MS/Open Offices,
     Google Spreadsheets).     
*** DONE an overview page with brief explanation of and links to all the reports :report:overview:
    CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 02:18]
** DONE simple UI (command line) with guiding messages                   :ui:
   CLOSED: [2012-01-13 Пт 14:23]
   for the user who runs the tests. Spend as little 
   efforts as possible on this task, to release quickly.
   4h
** DONE readme with explanation of the project goal and              :readme:
   CLOSED: [2012-01-10 Вт 05:05]
   how to use it
   5h
** DONE change db format                                                 :db:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   + test run as plist (:descr <descr> :run-results <run-results>)
     instead of just (<descr> <run-results>)
   + run-results as a list instead of plist; libname
     which was a plist key is now a property of the lib-result 
     object. It is more convenient for standard mapping functions, 
     instead of current do-lib-results.
** DONE add more libraries: total number of 20 libraries              :agent:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   is enough for the beginning.
   Result: we have 23 libraries.
** DONE when loading of a library or library test system              :agent:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   fails, ensure we have the error description in the output
   0.5h
** DONE The "thank you" message: where exactly to submit test results?
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   Specify an email or issue tracker of the cl-test-grid project.
** DONE how to store public (central) database and failed library 
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   outputs (files).
   An appealing way is to store it in the same git repository 
   on github, but with the std-out files the repository will 
   quickly grow to an unconvenient size (for new people the
   checkout procedure will be too long to be considered
   convenient)
   5h
   Solution: files are stored in Google App Engine blob store.
** DONE More detailed output for libraries using the RT test
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   framework. Ensure the libs with other test framework
   are all have sufficiently detailed output too.
** DONE Log of the BABEL tests (generated by the Stefil test          :agent:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:55]
   framework) does not contain information about
   errors. Add these details.
** DONE Some libraries (babel and cl-json) stil print messages to 
   CLOSED: [2011-12-18 Вс 01:56]
   console, meaning their output is not only *standard-output*
   and *standard-error*. Fix that, all the output
   should be in the log files, but not on console.
** DONE run the tests on all the implementations available for us.
   CLOSED: [2012-01-12 Чт 09:45]
** DONE publish the reports
   CLOSED: [2011-12-28 Ср 06:57]
** DONE test-run-info.lisp as attachment, instead of letter body     :server:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-29 Чт 04:53]
** DONE Fix lisp name sorting in pivot_lib-lisp_ql.html              :report:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-28 Ср 08:05]
** DONE finalize the decision what command user runs
   CLOSED: [2011-12-20 Вт 04:19]
   to performs the tests. Describe this main command
   in the README (in the first paragraph).
   The solution: user runs (load "agent.lisp"); precondition: quicklisp installed.
** DONE When the settings file is populated, inform user where     :settings:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-31 Сб 01:59]
   it is stored (and to be sure user understood us, ask
   him to press Enter before continuing).
** DONE When asking user for email, explain him more carefully     :settings:
   CLOSED: [2012-01-12 Чт 09:45]
   how the email will be used and ensure there is a way
   to avoid providing email.
** DONE ECL: recover from stack alexandria overflow and continute tests :ecl:agent:
   CLOSED: [2012-01-11 Ср 07:21]
** DONE ABCL: recover from cl-ppcre hung-up and continue tests   :abcl:agent:
   CLOSED: [2012-01-11 Ср 07:21]
** DONE Optimize horizontal space in the reports: the headers        :report:
   CLOSED: [2011-12-31 Сб 04:58]
   take to much space
** DONE more abstract accessor to parts of DB info instead of
   CLOSED: [2011-12-20 Вт 04:29]
   getf by properties: run-descr, run-results.
   1h
** DONE safe-read database
   CLOSED: [2011-12-20 Вт 04:29]
** DONE create a project with asdf system
   CLOSED: [2011-12-20 Вт 04:29]
   0.5h
** DONE DB file path based on the asdf system location
   CLOSED: [2011-12-20 Вт 04:29]
   0.5h
** DONE accumulate failed library output
   CLOSED: [2011-12-20 Вт 04:29]
   1h
** DONE run-libtests: redirect the library output to log file directly
   CLOSED: [2012-01-10 Вт 05:01]
   without caching it in memory. It is more convenient when you are 
   watching the testing process, you can observe the file being 
   populated with logs (because some libraries, like flexi-streams, 
   take time about minute to finish, and if during this minute
   nithing happens it is not user-friendly)

* Milestone 0.1
** DONE move closed TODO items to another (archive) file, so that the
   CLOSED: [2012-03-01 Чт 05:10]
   web presentation of the TODO file will be understandable 
   for the public.

** DONE new status, :expected-failure (or better :know-failure).
   CLOSED: [2012-03-01 Чт 05:05]
   Also maybe :unexpected-ok.
** DONE clean up the pivot reports Lisp code       :report:pivot:codequality:
   CLOSED: [2012-03-01 Чт 05:02]
* Milestone 0.3.1
** DONE automatically find regressions between quicklisp disto versions
   CLOSED: [2012-03-17 Ð¡Ð± 22:45]
** DONE test results detailed to individual tests for remaining test frameworks
   CLOSED: [2012-03-17 Ð¡Ð± 22:45]
** DONE add more libraries
   CLOSED: [2012-04-06 Пт 04:43]
   Added 34 libraries, the total number now is 57.
** DONE shorten the blob keys of online library logs
   CLOSED: [2012-04-06 Пт 04:46]


* 0.3.2 Reports Improve 1
** DONE floating report table headers, so that when we scroll, :report:pivot:
   CLOSED: [2012-04-22 Вс 04:14]
   headers are always visible and we always see what lisp/libary/lib-world
   corresponds to the table cell we are interested in.
** DONE Yellow color for known-fail and unexpected-ok aggregated statuses
   CLOSED: [2012-04-22 Вс 04:14]

* 0.3.3 Current: 
** DONE automate processing of library results submited by email
   CLOSED: [2012-06-15 Пт 01:46]
   
* 0.3.4 Test result for Quicklisp 2012-03, 2012-04
** DONE run tests with the newly added libraries on the quicklisp 2012-03-07,
   CLOSED: [2012-04-22 Вс 04:13]
   so that we can compare their results with the new quicklisp release 
   when it is out.
** DONE collect the test results for the next quicklisp release (2012-04-xx)
   CLOSED: [2012-04-22 Вс 04:13]
** DONE analyze the failures of Quicklisp 2012-04.
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Пн 04:39]
* 0.4.0 Test Running Robustness - lisp-agent
** DONE top level error handler in test-grid-agent:main
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Пн 20:17]
   write the unhandled error stacktrace (with causes)
   into log and exit - never enter debugger as the 
   program should be suitable to run in background with cron.
** DONE prevent starting of two agents (try to open a socket on a constant port)
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Пн 22:04]
** DONE create test-grid-agent:api-compatible-p
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Пн 23:45]
** DONE check what lisps other than CCL can run lisp-agent
   CLOSED: [2012-07-25 Ср 19:03]

** DONE update README.org to reflect the current status and priorities (in
   CLOSED: [2012-07-25 Ср 19:06]
   other words, reflect the changes during the last month)
** DONE prepare the announcement for the mailing-list
   CLOSED: [2012-07-27 Пт 05:48]
** DONE publish the lisp-agent - merge lisp-agent to master
   CLOSED: [2012-07-27 Пт 05:48]
** DONE Give every agent and unique ID. store the ID in the agent persistence.
   CLOSED: [2012-07-24 Вт 03:20]
** DONE error handling in the main process - during a test run and in other situations
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Пн 04:21]
   For example, after testing some library, the output file with library
   status is not found. Record :FAIL and proceed to further libraries.
   How to handle error during test results submission?
** DONE Agent: when test results upload failed, do not mark this lisp as tested in persistence.
   CLOSED: [2012-07-10 Вт 15:47]
** DONE run each test suite in a separate process
   CLOSED: [2012-06-15 Пт 01:44]
** DONE enforce the libraries source code recompilation on every test run
   CLOSED: [2012-07-09 Пн 16:54]
   by configuring asdf:output-translations to a temporary 
   subdirectory in the test-run directory
