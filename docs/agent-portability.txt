As of 2012-07-25 and quicklisp 2012-07-03 we have
the following situation:

CCL is the recommented choice, as it is the development platform
of test grid. Works on windows and linux (tested with CCL 1.8 and 1.7)
The command line to start agent with CCL:

    lx86cl --load run-agent.lisp --eval "(quit)"

SBCL doesn't work on windows at all (problem with external-program library).
On linux with SBCL we have problem when killing test-suite processes
if the test suite hangs (also probably external-program problem, tested with SBCL 1.0.57),
Anyway, here are the SBCL parameters:

    export SBCL_HOME=/home/testgrid/lisps/sbcl-1.0.57/lib/sbcl
    /home/testgrid/lisps/sbcl-1.0.57/bin/sbcl --load run-agent.lisp --eval "(quit)"


CLISP 2.49 Windows - Doesn't work.
(Something seems to be wrong in external-program
with passing program parameters)

    clisp -x (load "run-agent.lisp")'


ABCL - I don't know, but at least it would take some effort.
I stopped when ABCL required JNA for CFFI (JNA is a Java 
library to work with FFI). I need to learn
how to make JNA available for ABCL.

    java -jar abcl.jar --batch --load run-agent.lisp


CMUCL - Doesn't work (tested on cmu-20crelease-20c20c_unicode-linux-x86).
The first issue encountered is with external-program:
https://github.com/sellout/external-program/issues/12)
    
    /opt/cmucl-20c/bin/lisp -load run-agent.lisp -eval "(quit)" 


ECL - Doesn't work (tested with ecl-12.7.1-dee2506a-win-x86).
When it starts child CCL process to update quicklisp, the CCL crashes.

    ecl -load run-agent.lisp -eval "(quit)"


Allegro - problem with memoizing generic a function:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/cl-test-grid/Vnl3kHJbQ0M
The issue is fixed since then, but no further testing of agent was done.

    alisp -qq -L run-agent.lisp


Other Lisps - not tested.
