** DONE kill process tree on unix in case the test suite exceeded timeout
   CLOSED: [2013-11-09 Сб 20:26]
   Currenlty we only kill the lisp process, but not it's children.
   Some test suites may start other programs, and it makes sense
   to kill the testsuite child process too. Implementation hint:
   the most portable API on unix to find out child processes,
   as it seems to be, is the ps program. We will need to
   implement a shell script killproctree.sh <pid> which uses
   ps to find all descendents and kill them. Portable format
   of ps arguments should be used.

   The thread wich has lead to implementing the solution:

** DONE Adjust cl-fad testsuite adapter

   Github recently has broken the code colorer. The lines
   which does not fit into the code block width are wrapped,
   and so all the indentation is broken and unreadable.

   Previously the lines were not wraped, but code block just
   had a horizontal scrollbar.

   The solution: do not specify the programming language.
   In this case the code is not colored, but the indentation
   is reflected as necessary.

   CLOSED: [2015-11-07 Суб 05:10]
   After Quicklisp updates dist version, the tarballs and sources
   of old library versions not used by new dist remain on the file system.
   It is desirable to remove them to save disk space.

   Use (ql-dist:clean (ql-dist:dist "qlalpha")) during the quicklisp update.
   Of course, sometimes we may want the old archives to remain present,
   in case we want to return to old version. But that's rare case,
   so the simple solution of always purging old versions could be
   the right thing.
* Engage People (ideas)
** TODO Invite test-runners by publishing clearly my needs:
   - Coverage table for Quicklisp testing,
     clearly showing what lisps/platforms are missed.

   - May serve also as a part of the "Contributors" section of
     README - shows who is currently covers what lisps.
     This will also allow particular
     lisp developers (e.g. SBCL devs) to contact directly
     with their lisp testers.

   - Table with current release testing status for
     various lisps. For example SBCL releases every month,
     it will almost always present there. Coverage table for
     pre-release testing of particular lisps. SBCL is the
     most demanding in this respect, as they have release
     every month.

   with cl-test-grid in the future).
** TODO If noone contributes ACL results, ask Robert Goldman

** TODO Possible donors
   - Franz expressed interest in using cl-test-grid and
     asked for instructions, but seems like thay have no
     time (have more important priorities)?
     Would they be willing to pay someone for performing
     regular testing?
   - Fare told "they" can maintain in the form of money donations
     (paying for servers).
   - Christoph Rhodes and SBCL team?
   - Dave Cooper said he knows possible sponsors (ALU and some others)
     but they want clear list of goals. May coverate tables will be
     clear in the real-time needs of the projects, donors can fund
     it task by taks, with small payments.
     Contact Dave when I produce enough visibility for project goals
     and needs. It must be noted that sponsors participation
     would be good for goal definitions. People who want to see
     SBCL tested pay for SBCL, those who want to see ACL tested pay
     for this, those interested in Quicklisp pre-release tesging
     donate for this.

** TODO recover from submit-results failure
   When log files are uploaded sucessfully, but the test-run-info.lisp
   upload fails, the agent restarted next time tries to repeat full test run.
   It's because the test-run-info.lisp is considered finished - it already has log IDs.
   Therefore agent doesn not try to complete it.
   And agent doesn't have the lisp implementation recorded in the
   :DONE-TESTS property in the persistence.lisp

** TODO [4 h] document, for each CL community role, how he can benefit from testgrid
   - library mainaner:
     - Status of your library ASDF systems loaded by various lisps
     - If you have a testsuite, results of your test suite on various lisps
     - Updated with every quicklisp distro
     - Regressions (desirable to show regression
       history along quicklisp versions).
   - lisp implementation maintener
     - How you lisp is supported by libraries
     - What libraries are most importatn to fix,
       to unlock your lisp to maximum amount
       of code (other libraries), and correspondingly
       to users
     - Pre-release testing: run tests on the new version,
       compare with results of the previous release,
       ensure there is no regressions and see improvements.
   - distribution maintainer (Quicklisp):
     - release testing: run tests on the same lisp implemetations
       as run on the previouse release, and compare results:
       ensure there is no regressions, and see the improvements.
   - application developer
     (Actually, the application developer as the end user
     of CL infrastructuure, rarely will use testgrid directly.
     He, hopefully, will benefit indirectly, from improved
     stability and quality of the CL world).
     Still, the end user may:
     - see what libraries work on his platform
     - giving his ASDF system see what dependencies
       are broken on what platform
** TODO [2 h] document the security issue: agent runs lot of code provided by unknown people

   This includes:
   - confidence in their good intentions
   - confidence their code don't open unintentional doors to the machine
     (e.g. opens a socker, receives s-expression from it and executes)

   Anyway, the final solution will most likely be to advice
   contributors to run agent under a separate user on their OSes.
** TODO Apply for a subdomain at common-lisp.net, e.g. test-grid.common-lisp.net,
   It is another way to solve the security issue with HTML injections,

** TODO Test source control HEADs of libraries, not only quicklisp releases
   Rrequires a way to specify lib-wold as a quicklisp version with some
   library versions overriden (checkout this particular
   libraries from the scm), so that library author can quickly
   get test result for his changes (fixes)  in scm.
   An implementation idea to consider: almost every scm allows
   to download asnapshot via http, so the quicklisp http machinery may
   be reused here, whithout running a shell command for

** TODO Add more test suites

           with a word "test" in the system name;
           ordered by the project download count.

    detect-test-systems.lisp - the lisp code which
          generated the test-systems file

    quicklisp-download-statistics-2012.txt - quiclisp download statistics

    coverage.org - information about the libraries already reviewed:
          whether it is added to test grid, and if not added - why
         (no test suite, needs manual configuration, hangs, etc.)
          The libraries are ordered in alphabetical order.

*** TODO create drakma test suite - will ensure drakma works on all the lisps.
    Drakma test suite is a must. HTTP client today is as vital thing
    as file system access. It should work on all the lisps.
    Create a test suite, the simples one - download one file
    form common-lisp.net. And make sure it works on all the lisps.

  - project name: a keyword, or string? Currently a keyword; but ASDF system names are strings.
  - rename test-grid-testsuites:*all-libs* to *all-testsuites*?
  - I often call library test logs "blobs", while it would be more correct to say "logs",
    because they are have conctrete context type text/hmlt and will have content encoding "gzip"

*** TODO CLISP (build a multithreaded version)
** TODO For all the libraries which need specific environment
   (like cffi, cl-sql) correctly detect the absense of required
   envorinment and return :NO-RESOURCE status and provide guiding message to the
   user how to configure them (log to the output test output?).

   This may be implemented by invoking generic function
   (test-grid-testsuites:check-enviroment <library-name> <test-enviroment-object>) => :NO-RESOURCE or :OK,
   by default returns :OK, but the library maintainer
   may define a method for his library which checks for available envoriment
   and return :NO-RESOURCE, or if the enviroment is OK
   returns :OK and may store some data on the test-envormment-object.

   Then (test-grid-testsuites:libtest <library-name> <test-enviroment-object>) is
   called by agent. So the check-envoronment method may pass enviroment
   information (for examle DB connection parametrs for cl-sql) to the test suite.

   Also we need to define a way for check-enviromnent to be configured
   by the end-user who runs the agent, because every installation
   may have different DB connection parameters. For example, check-enviroment
   may load a file <workdir>/test-configs/<library-name>-config.lisp.
   This file is expected to be provided by the user who runs agant
   and is willing to spend an extra effort to contribute test
   results for these libraries (this is optional of course).

   We may provide only the API and leave the implementation
   of check-environment methods to the library maintainers, because
   othersize it may take very long time for us to impelement
   it for all such libraries.

   Although, for the most important libraries which don't have
   enough maintainers we could provide implementation.
** TODO Introduce an option to limit agent run time
  Use case: someone wants to run agents at night, but have
  the machine free from agent during dayly work.
  We will provide and option the user can configure in run-agent.lisp
  which limits agent run time so that agent exits after this duration.

  Before terminating agent should sumbit the results accumulated to server
  (even partial test runs). This is necessary becase we can not
  be sure the user will ever start the agent again.

  This also means that if next time agent is started, it should
  know what part of test run is completed, and continue for
  remaining projects (record the completenes status
  per library in persistence.lisp instead of whole
  quicklisp distros?)
** TODO A "quit" command for soft termination of the agent instead of killing it
   Will ensure agent finishes only afther all his child processes
   are finished, so that starting agent again is safe.

   How the command should be sent to agent? Via web interface?
   Lisp command from REPL?

** TODO test run duration should be decreased by the time of hibernation

   Do it autmatically, or send email to all the contributors, or just ignore this issue
** TODO Admin stores a hashmap for lisps to be tested (or skipped)
    by particular agent in the aget sources (note, the agent
    updates the source every time from git) This allows to distribute work
    between agents having overlaping sets of lisp implementations.
    Need a mechanizm for announcing the lisps present on
    agent (probably just add agent-id to the test run
    description submitted form agent to admin, and this as an announcement).
    As the compilers versions are changed, probably the
    hashmap to store responsibility specifications should
    contain not full lisp implementation identifier,
    but only generic name, like SBCL instead of SBCL 1.0.57.
    But allow for ECL-bytecode to be distingueshed from
    ECL-lisp-to-c. I.e. in the end we can get some kind
    of patterns for lisp implementation identifier. And
    the identifier will be a structured object, not just
    a string; provably it will even contains *features*
    of the lisp implementaion.
** TODO recompile cl-test-grid-agent sources at every agetn run?

** TODO Project dependencies info is hardcoded from quicklisp 2012-09-09. Make it more flexible

** TODO Child processes collision if agent is restarted very soon after it was killed.
   Agent is pretty resistent to restarts. If it is killed
   and started again, it can continue test run from the point
   reached previously.
   It prevents of starting of several agent instances by "locking"
   via opening a TCP port.
   If laptop is hibernated, after waking up agent re-runs the
   testsuite interrupted by hibernation (to avoid possible
   problems with lost network connections of the testsuite,
   and similar).

   But there is one problem. If we kill agant, we don't
   kill its child processes running tests.
   If we start another agent before the child process finishes
   (completes the testuite or loads the ASDF system), then
   new agent is anaware about the child process, and may start
   new process with the same task. These two child processes,
   the old one and the new one, may intefrere, for example
   thying to write to the same .fasl file, and to the same
   log file.

   How to solve this?
   - To solve what exactly?
   - To ensure, the child process run by new agent,
     the result of which finally gets into the DB,
     is not affected by obsolete child processes
     of the old agent.

** TODO Rebuild the free lisps from source control daily, before running test-grid-agent
** TODO Enable HTTP caching for library test logs (good recipe: https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/caching)
** TODO add CCL revision to the version string (I have impression
   that CCL versions checked out at different time from the official release SVN
   svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/release/1.8/darwinx86/ccl
   may be different. I.e. despite it is called "release 1.8", the mainteiners
   commit fixes there, and the version string we use now - "ccl-1.8-f95-linux-x86",
   does not reflect this. In other words, our version string does not
   identify CCL uniquly.
** TODO code coverage: SBCL provides sb-cover. Integrate it somehow
        and publish in the reports.
        How?
        - extend the lib-result object with one more field, percentage 
          of the covered lines?
        - separate report?
        - or just output the information into the log?
** TODO osicat: automate the :no-resource condition
** TODO ABCL, cffi tests: return :no-resource if JNA is not available
** TODO cffi tests: return :no-resource if C compilation fails on linux
** TODO cl-fad and flexi-streams use c:\tmp as a temporary directory
   on Windows; it's not very good. Maybe try to provide them
   with a temporary directory inside of the cl-test-grid working
   dir?
** TODO quicklisp distro version in report headers may be a link to
   list of library versions in this ql version
   (like this: http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/releases.html, but
   it's only for the latest QL).
** TODO Description of CSV report may link to an example of the CSV report  :report:overview:
   imported to a Google Spreadsheet
   with pivot calculating avearage duration of 
   tests for every library.
** TODO spell check the reports-overview                    :report:overview:
** TODO quick access to the test run info from the pivot report table cell  :report:pivot:
   (or maybe just print the test run info to the log, like a header;
    but it is a duplication and also we will have invonviniences
    if we want to modify this infromation in the lob BLOB)
** TODO Limit library output file size stored on file system (how?).
   Note, the size of file submitted online is limited already
** TODO finalize the terminology we use in the code
   to refer our main data:
   - test status for a particular library
   - library test result object (includes the status
     as well as log length, the key of the log
     in the online blob store, probably the
     library test duration)
   - list of library test results in a particular test
     run
   - test run description, consists of lisp name,
     libraries set (think quicklisp distro),
     the user contacts, total test run duration,
     etc.
** TODO when GAE quotas (for requests, emails, anything else)
   are exceeded, recognize it and display a meaningfull
   message to the user.
** TODO usocket test suite might need manual configuration,
   see their README. Distinguish the case
   when the manual configuration hasn't been
   performed and return :no-resource status.
** TODO An utility to delete blobs not used in db.lisp from the blobstore :server:
