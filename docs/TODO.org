** DONE combine information about load failures with information about system dependencies
   CLOSED: [2012-10-01 Пн 07:12]
   It will allow us to find "root" compilation blockers -
   the libraries which do not compile and block other libraries
   compilation.

   After the milestone 0.5.1 we will have compilation status
   for all the ASDF systems in quicklisp on all the lisp implemetations.

   If we combine the compilation statuses with the dependency
   information, it will become visible, what libraries should
   be fixed first to make certain lisp implementation wider adopted.

   Of course, quicklisp download statistics we have already
   provides some information about "importance" of libraries,
   but the dependency information will make the situation more clear.

   This feature is suggested by Juan Jose - the ECL maintainer.


   We now have information which ASDF systems fail to load on particular Lisps
   (this is implemented for the 56 libraries already included into the test-grid,
   and After the milestone 0.5.1 we will have compilation status
   for all the ASDF systems in quicklisp on all the lisp implemetations).

   But ASDF systems depend on each other, so if system A fails to load,
   all other systems which depend on A directly or indirectly fail to load as well.
   So if we just list all the load failures, we are going to have large list, but will
   be unable to see where the real problem is, what is necessary to fix.

   The idea is to combine the information about load failures with information
   about dependencies to find out the root "blockers" - the libraries failing by
   themselves and blocking others.

   To do so we may just sort the ASDF systems by dependencies
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting), and the root blockers
   will be at the top of the list.

   I envision simple report in the form

   system-a: blocked-by: <list of failed systems on which system-a depends>; blocks <list of failed systems depending on system-a>
   system-b: blocked-by: <list of failed systems on which system-b depends>; blocks <list of failed systems depending on system-b>
   ...

   While the real data is not available, you can just hardcode
   two stub functions:
   (load-failed-p <system name>) => true or false,
   and
   (dependencies <system name>) => list of systems on which the given system depends.

   With hardcoded stub information we may already experiment and develop with the report.

   Also, we can extract the dependency information for the real implementation
   of the DEPENDENCIES function. It may be done either by loading
   every system and querying ASDF, or from quicklisp - see file quicklisp\dists\quicklisp\systems.txt
   in your quicklisp installation. Note, there is no way to detect 100% exact
   dependency information, because .asd files are just lisp code,
   and some of them just do (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'something)
   instead of putting something to :depend-on clause of defsystem macro.
   But the information which IS possible to extract will give us good results
   I believe.

** DONE the diff report (aka regressions report) - diff along various dimentions
   CLOSED: [2012-10-01 Пн 08:26]
   Currently we can only find differences between test statuses
   of a library on different quicklisps, when the lisp implementation
   version is a constant.
   We should generalize this to compare test results on two
   different versions of a compiler (windows/linux or old compiler
   version and new one). Also when comparing test results,
   we must be more flexible than matching results only of
   exactly the same lisp-implementation-identifier,
   because we don't always has exactly this lisp.
   For example when we compare the lates qicklisp version
   with the previous one, we may want to consider ecl-12.7.1-dee2506a-linux-x86-lisp-to-c
   and ecl-12.7.1-xxxxffff-linux-x86-lisp-to-c as the same compiler,
   because otherwise we might just have no results to compare.

   In other case, we want to compare test results of these two
   compilers. Then we consider them different and
   different sides of comparision: one on the left hand,
   and another on the right side.

   At first sight the task may be solved
   by parametrizing the report by two functions:
   - the one which decides what results to put to left side and to right side
   - a predicate which decides if a result cell from the left side is comparable
     to a result from the right side.

  ==============
  The solution:
  - select two sets of results
  - compute exclusive-or of them
  - print pivot with necessary columns and rows

  Example is the compiler-diff report and quicklisp-diff

   Now that test grid agent can be run by cron, sending confirmation

   because the contributor is anaware when testing happens. But providing
   feedback is necessary. We may send a monthly digest to contributor
   summarizing the test results received from his agent(s). May be implemented
   as a cron task running say at the 8th of every month (so that admin has
   time to commit all the resutls to db.lisp and the digest
   producer task sees them). Admin should be BCC'ed in these emails.
   Should it be a single email for all contributors and the mailing list,
   or each contributor should be emailed individually?

   Solution: the email is sent manually with help of
   tg-reporting::contributors function, which prepares the email test.

     - How you lisp is supported by libraries
     - What libraries are most importatn to fix,
       to unlock your lisp to maximum amount
       of code (other libraries), and correspondingly
       to users
     - Pre-release testing: run tests on the new version,
       compare with results of the previous release,
       ensure there is no regressions and see improvements.
   - distribution maintainer (Quicklisp):
     - release testing: run tests on the same lisp implemetations
       as run on the previouse release, and compare results:
       ensure there is no regressions, and see the improvements.
   - application developer
     (Actually, the application developer as the end user
     of CL infrastructuure, rarely will use testgrid directly.
     He, hopefully, will benefit indirectly, from improved
     stability and quality of the CL world).

     - see what libraries work on his platform
     - giving his ASDF system see what dependencies

*** TODO CLISP (build a multithreaded version)
** TODO For all the libraries which need specific environment
   (like cffi, cl-sql) correctly detect the absense of required
   envorinment and return :NO-RESOURCE status and provide guiding message to the
   user how to configure them (log to the output test output?).

   This may be implemented by invoking generic function
   (test-grid-testsuites:check-enviroment <library-name> <test-enviroment-object>) => :NO-RESOURCE or :OK,
   by default returns :OK, but the library maintainer
   may define a method for his library which checks for available envoriment
   and return :NO-RESOURCE, or if the enviroment is OK
   returns :OK and may store some data on the test-envormment-object.

   Then (test-grid-testsuites:libtest <library-name> <test-enviroment-object>) is
   called by agent. So the check-envoronment method may pass enviroment
   information (for examle DB connection parametrs for cl-sql) to the test suite.

   Also we need to define a way for check-enviromnent to be configured
   by the end-user who runs the agent, because every installation
   may have different DB connection parameters. For example, check-enviroment
   may load a file <workdir>/test-configs/<library-name>-config.lisp.
   This file is expected to be provided by the user who runs agant
   and is willing to spend an extra effort to contribute test
   results for these libraries (this is optional of course).

   We may provide only the API and leave the implementation
   of check-environment methods to the library maintainers, because
   othersize it may take very long time for us to impelement
   it for all such libraries.

   Although, for the most important libraries which don't have
   enough maintainers we could provide implementation.
** TODO foreign library load errors should be recognized and represented
   in test results (maybe as :no-resource status, but it's better
   to have a special status, including the library name. that way
   we will have up to date list of foreign libraries necessary
   to have quicklisp fully working).

   Catch CFFI conditions, and in case of ABCL, failure to load JNA classes.
   This should be done for load test and for testsuite run.

   After this is implemented, it is desirable to re-run the tests on
   the current and the previous Quicklisps, so that we don't redundant
   items in the diff report (what previous was a load failure
   now becomes :no-resource - not a failure).
** TODO Introduce an option to limit agent run time
  Use case: someone wants to run agents at night, but have
  the machine free from agent during dayly work.
  We will provide and option the user can configure in run-agent.lisp
  which limits agent run time so that agent exits after this duration.

  Before terminating agent should sumbit the results accumulated to server
  (even partial test runs). This is necessary becase we can not
  be sure the user will ever start the agent again.

  This also means that if next time agent is started, it should
  know what part of test run is completed, and continue for
  remaining projects (record the completenes status
  per library in persistence.lisp instead of whole
  quicklisp distros?)
** TODO A "quit" command for soft termination of the agent instead of killing it
   Will ensure agent finishes only afther all his child processes
   are finished, so that starting agent again is safe.

   How the command should be sent to agent? Via web interface?
   Lisp command from REPL?

** TODO test run duration should be decreased by the time of hibernation

    Need a mechanizm for announcing the lisps present on
    agent (probably just add agent-id to the test run
    description submitted form agent to admin, and this as an announcement).
    As the compilers versions are changed, probably the
    hashmap to store responsibility specifications should
    contain not full lisp implementation identifier,
    but only generic name, like SBCL instead of SBCL 1.0.57.
    But allow for ECL-bytecode to be distingueshed from
    ECL-lisp-to-c. I.e. in the end we can get some kind
    of patterns for lisp implementation identifier. And
    the identifier will be a structured object, not just
    a string; provably it will even contains *features*
    of the lisp implementaion.
** TODO Agent: retry when test results upload failed.
** TODO recompile cl-test-grid-agent sources at every agetn run?
   As currently ASDF doesn't rebuild depending libraries
   when the libraries they depend on changed (add
   links to this TODO item when Internet connection
   will be up)

** TODO kill process tree on unix in case the test suite exceeded timeout
   Currenlty we only kill the lisp process, but not it's children.
   Some test suites may start other programs, and it makes sense
   to kill the testsuite child process too. Implementation hint:
   the most portable API on unix to find out child processes,
   as it seems to be, is the ps program. We will need to
   implement a shell script killtree.sh <pid> which uses
   ps to find all descendents and kill them. Portable format
   of ps arguments should be used.
** TODO consider what test suite timeout value is the best (30 mins currently)
** TODO should the lisp-process-timeout condition inherit from serous-condition, error, or just condition?
** TODO program parameters escaping is not perfect. When we
   run CLISP as an external process, it can not stand
   string literals with " inside.
** TODO enable/disable program parameters escapting depending on the
   external-program behaviour (consider also using input stream
   of the lisp process, or a temporary file)
** TODO prevent test run directory names conflict (currently they
   are named by timestamp with resolution to seconds)
** TODO temp file naming: ensure unique [probably specify random-state]
** TODO persistence.lisp format - sort and newline for every record
** TODO refactor agent, to make the low-level building blocks suitable
   for the following use cases:
   - pre-release tesf of lisp compiler: do not delete test run info (as vsedach asked)
   - test of new ASDF version (ensure the new ASDF is loaded before quicklisp/setup.lisp is loaded)
   - test of patched quicklisp
** TODO Project dependencies info is hardcoded from quicklisp 2012-09-09. Make it more flexible
   and use the dependency info for the quicklisp we generate report for.
** TODO Child processes collision if agent is restarted very soon after it was killed.
   Agent is pretty resistent to restarts. If it is killed
   and started again, it can continue test run from the point
   reached previously.
   It prevents of starting of several agent instances by "locking"
   via opening a TCP port.
   If laptop is hibernated, after waking up agent re-runs the
   testsuite interrupted by hibernation (to avoid possible
   problems with lost network connections of the testsuite,
   and similar).

   But there is one problem. If we kill agant, we don't
   kill its child processes running tests.
   If we start another agent before the child process finishes
   (completes the testuite or loads the ASDF system), then
   new agent is anaware about the child process, and may start
   new process with the same task. These two child processes,
   the old one and the new one, may intefrere, for example
   thying to write to the same .fasl file, and to the same
   log file.

   How to solve this?
   - To solve what exactly?
   - To ensure, the child process run by new agent,
     the result of which finally gets into the DB,
     is not affected by obsolete child processes
     of the old agent.

** TODO add CCL revision to the version string (I have impression
   that CCL versions checked out at different time from the official release SVN
   svn co http://svn.clozure.com/publicsvn/openmcl/release/1.8/darwinx86/ccl
   may be different. I.e. despite it is called "release 1.8", the mainteiners
   commit fixes there, and the version string we use now - "ccl-1.8-f95-linux-x86",
   does not reflect this. In other words, our version string does not
   identify CCL uniquly.
** TODO code coverage: SBCL provides sb-cover. Integrate it somehow
        and publish in the reports.
        How?
        - extend the lib-result object with one more field, percentage 
          of the covered lines?
        - separate report?
        - or just output the information into the log?
